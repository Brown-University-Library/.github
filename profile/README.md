# Brown Library GitHub Best practices

## Security

### Main security message:

*Never Commit Sensitive Information* â€” even if the repository is private. 

### How to reliably do this?

**Keep private things out of the github code directory**

* _Keep out of code, and the github code directory:_
  - passwords
  - API keys
  - server paths
  - database-structure info (where reasonably possible)
  - private settings
  - shell-scripts that set environmental variables
  - log-files (which can sometimes contain sensitive info)

* _Implementation:_ One common pattern is to have a "project_outer_directory" that contains these things (as well as the "project_code_directory"), and only commit the  "project_code_directory" to github. 

* _Utilize environment variables:_ Store sensitive information in environment variables, set outside of the git-directory and thus not able to be accidentally committed. All languages support common ways of doing this.
 
* _Do not depend on the .gitignore file for security:_ Rather, get in the habit of thinking of the .gitignore file as keeping messy-unnecessary-cruft out of github (like virtual-environments or auto-compiled *.pyc files), not as basic security. Instead, keep the sensitive info out of the github directory in the first place.

## Other recommended GitHub practices...
* Include a README, preferably with an explanation of the repo's Purpose, Usage, and Installation
* Make it clear which team at BUL "owns" the repo
* Add a "Description"
* Include "dependencies" in such a way that github can auto-scan them and notify you of vulnerabilities
* If you have a `dotenv` with private info &mdash; as noted above it should not be in the repo &mdash; but it's useful to have a `sample_dotenv.txt` file for users to get a sense of what kind of info is required.
* the `main` branch is special: it should _always_ work.
* There should be a "release" for every version of the code actually deployed. (That makes it easier to know which commit to revert back to if there's a problem.)
